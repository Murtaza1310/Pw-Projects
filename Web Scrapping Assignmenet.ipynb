    "Web scraping is an automated method of extracting data from websites. It involves using software to collect and analyze data from web pages, and then saving that data in a structured format such as a spreadsheet or database. Web scraping is used for a variety of purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Price monitoring**: Web scraping can be used to monitor prices of products on e-commerce websites, allowing businesses to adjust their prices accordingly and stay competitive ¹.\n",
    "2. **Market research**: Web scraping can be used to gather data on competitors, such as their pricing strategies, product offerings, and customer reviews ¹.\n",
    "3. **Lead generation**: Web scraping can be used to extract contact information from websites, such as email addresses and phone numbers, which can be used for marketing purposes ¹.\n",

    "3. **HTTP programming**: This method involves using HTTP requests to retrieve data from web pages, which can then be parsed and analyzed ¹.\n",
    "4. **HTML parsing**: This method involves parsing the HTML code of a web page to extract the relevant data ¹.\n",
    "5. **DOM parsing**: This method involves parsing the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page to extract the relevant data ¹.\n",
    "6. **Vertical aggregation**: This method involves aggregating data from multiple web pages that share a common structure ¹.\n",
    "7. **Semantic annotation recognizing**: This method involves using machine learning algorithms to recognize and extract specific types of data from web pages ¹.\n",
    "8. **Computer vision web-page analysis**: This method involves using computer vision algorithms to analyze the visual content of web pages and extract relevant data ¹."

It also helps to organize and format the messy web data by fixing bad HTML and present to us in an easily-traversible XML structures ¹. \n",

    "1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: This is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. In a web scraping project, EC2 instances can be used to run the scraping scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: This is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. The scraped data can be stored in S3 buckets for persistent storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AWS Lambda**: This is a serverless compute service that lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda can be used to run scraping scripts on a schedule or in response to triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: This is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. If the scraped data is structured, it can be stored in an RDS database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Amazon CloudWatch**: This is a monitoring and observability service. It can be used to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. CloudWatch can be used to monitor the scraping process and send alerts in case of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **AWS Glue**: This is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load your data for analytics. If the scraped data needs to be transformed before storage or analysis, AWS Glue can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the actual services used can vary based on the specific requirements of the project. It's always best to choose the services that best fit the project's needs."
